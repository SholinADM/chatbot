## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

Create branches using this format:

```
Example: `feature/john-data-preprocessing`

### Making Changes

1. Always create a new branch for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/[your-username]-[feature-name]
   ```

2. Keep your fork updated:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

3. Update your feature branch with latest changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/[your-username]-[feature-name]
   git merge main
   ```
